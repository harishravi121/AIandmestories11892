## **Scene 1: The Lost Car**

[SCENE START]

**INT. MALL PARKING LOT - DAY**

*A bustling mall parking lot. People are rushing in and out, cars are parked haphazardly.*

**ANITA:** (Mid-30s, frustrated) Where did I park this car? I swear it was here.

**RAHUL:** (Late 20s, confused) Are you sure? Let's try walking around.

**ANITA:** (Sighs) I’m so sure. I remember the red pillar and the family with the stroller.

*They walk around for a few minutes, growing increasingly anxious.*

**RAHUL:** (Panicking) We can’t be losing a car in a parking lot!

[SCENE END]

## **Scene 2: The Discovery**

[SCENE START]

*They spot the car, but it’s in a different spot, a few rows away.*

**ANITA:** (Confused) That’s my car, but how did it get here?

**RAHUL:** (Intrigued) Maybe someone moved it by accident.

**A mysterious OLD MAN, with a knowing glint in his eye, walks by.**

**OLD MAN:** (Muttering to himself) Kids these days, can’t park a car to save their lives.

*Anita and Rahul exchange puzzled glances.*

**ANITA:** (To Rahul) Did you hear that?

**RAHUL:** (Shakes his head) I don’t know what’s going on.

[SCENE END]

## **Scene 3: The Mysterious Stranger**

[SCENE START]

*Intrigued, they decide to follow the old man.*

**RAHUL:** (Whispering) Should we follow him?

**ANITA:** (Nods) Let’s see where he’s going.

*They follow him discreetly. The old man leads them to a secluded corner of the parking lot.*

**OLD MAN:** (Turns around, smiling) Lost your car, have you?

**ANITA & RAHUL:** (Surprised) Yes, how did you know?

**OLD MAN:** (Chuckles) Old habits die hard. I used to work as a parking attendant. I saw your car was blocking someone in, so I moved it. 

**ANITA & RAHUL:** (Relieved) Oh, thank goodness!

**OLD MAN:** (Winks) No problem. Just remember, always park sensibly.

*The old man walks away, leaving Anita and Rahul to ponder the strange turn of events.*
